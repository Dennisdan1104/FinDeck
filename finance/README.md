# FinDeck Finance Layer

English | [中文](README.zh.md)

This directory holds everything FinDeck layers on top of the upstream harness, in these parts:

| Path | Contents |
|---|---|
| `skills/` | The AI's "manuals" (13), mounted into every session |
| `pipelines/` | Scheduled asset pipelines (`<name>.yaml` definitions + step scripts): `daily-refresh` (panel → model → report) and `weekly-healthcheck` (asset health report) |
| `face-spec/` | Asset-face spec: `face.schema.json` + `validate_face.py` + examples, and `verb-bridge.md`, the protocol the face uses to run library verbs |
| `workbenches/` | Work-mode definitions (`<name>.yaml`): a named asset set plus its run conventions, read by `python -m findeck.workbench` (`list`/`show`/`validate`) |
| `python/findeck/` | Built-in toolkit modules: `assets` (global asset library), `background` (detached run records shared by the `verb_bridge` and `pipeline` CLIs), `charts` (chart factory), `pipeline` (pipeline.yaml validator/executor), `quickmodels` (unified modeling), `snapshot` (data snapshots), `verb_bridge` (face verb execution bridge), `workbench` (workbench.yaml validator and brief generator) |
| `python/.venv/` | Data environment (created by the setup scripts; registers the findeck package via `.pth`) |
| `python/requirements-data.txt` | Preinstalled list, with upper bounds (data + sklearn/lightgbm/statsmodels) |
| `python/setup-env.ps1` / `.sh` | Idempotent bootstrap (Tsinghua mirror first, `FD_PIP_INDEX` overrides) |
| `python/smoke-test.py` | Data source health check (PASS when any domestic source works) |
| `python/test-toolbox.py` | Toolkit regression test (models + charts + snapshots + assets) |
| `python/migrate-assets.py` | One-off registration of the existing `data/` parquet files as `dataset` assets; idempotent and rerunnable |
| `experiments/` | Repeatable experiments (A/B validation of the iteration-correction idea) |
| `README.md` | This file |

## Design principles

1. **Data and classic models preinstalled, heavy models on demand.** Data fetching plus
   ridge/random-forest/LightGBM/ARIMA (sklearn/lightgbm/statsmodels, through the unified
   `findeck` toolkit where the AI tunes via `params`); PyTorch-scale stacks (several GB)
   are installed per task, with the model-map skill as the guide.
2. **Skills only point the way; they don't ship payloads.** Every skill is plain Markdown:
   interface names, parameters, code templates, and known pitfalls. The AI can act after
   reading, and humans can read and maintain them directly.
3. **Minimal intrusion upstream.** The finance layer reaches a session through named rows in the shipped compositions, not through changes to harness packages: `packages/bundle/base/cordis.patch.yml` points skill-filesystem's `customSkillDirs` at `finance/skills/` and lists the FinDeck plugins (`tool-asset-library`, `tool-thesis`, `tool-memory`, `redblue`, `roundtable`, `tool-roundtable`), and each agent preset under `packages/preset/agent-presets/presets/` mounts the same skills directory on its own skill-filesystem row. Everything else the finance layer contributes is new files, so it carries across upstream updates; the composition and the plugin loading rules are documented in [docs/architecture.md](../docs/architecture.md).

## Skills

| Skill | Role |
|---|---|
| `findeck-research` | Master SOP: research workflow + iteration-correction protocol + report template + disciplines |
| `findeck-market-data-cn` | A-shares/HK/macro/news (akshare, baostock fallback) |
| `findeck-market-data-global` | US/global/crypto (yfinance, ccxt), FRED |
| `findeck-quant-models` | Model map: built-in toolkit usage + on-demand neural nets + evaluation discipline |
| `findeck-backtesting` | vectorbt/backtrader templates + metric reading + pitfall list |
| `findeck-visualization` | Charting rules: charts toolkit + the read_image display path |
| `findeck-factor-analysis` | Factor testing: IC/layering/collinearity/turnover |
| `findeck-portfolio` | Portfolio construction: equal-weight/min-variance/risk-parity/MVO |
| `findeck-macro-playbook` | Macro playbooks: Merrill clock / rate transmission / credit cycle / policy |
| `findeck-python-env` | Data environment manual (paths/mirrors/caches/troubleshooting) |
| `findeck-pipeline` | Asset pipelines: `pipeline.yaml` format, step marker protocol, manual run + `schedule_create` cron wiring, failure semantics |
| `findeck-asset-face` | Generating an asset face: the 8-component vocabulary, per-kind "good face" rules, storage + manifest declaration, validator gate |
| `findeck-workbench` | Work-mode operation: the `workbench.yaml` format, the opening asset brief, and the run-and-report discipline |

## Data environment

```bash
bash finance/python/setup-env.sh                 # Linux/macOS/Git-Bash
powershell -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File finance/python/setup-env.ps1   # Windows
```

This creates `finance/python/.venv` (preinstalled list in `requirements-data.txt`; the setup
script registers the `findeck` package into the venv via `.pth`). The script is idempotent,
defaults to the Tsinghua mirror (`FD_PIP_INDEX` overrides), and falls back to the official
index on failure.

Toolkit regression: `finance/python/.venv/Scripts/python.exe finance/python/test-toolbox.py`
(runs models + charts + snapshot discipline + asset-library round-trip). The script reuses the
`data/market_cn_600519_daily_bs.parquet` cache when present; otherwise it fetches 600519 daily
bars from akshare once and writes that cache, and falls back to a deterministic synthetic OHLCV
fixture when the network is unavailable. It prints which path it took.

After setup, run the smoke test: `finance/python/.venv/Scripts/python.exe finance/python/smoke-test.py`
(fetches real data from every source; PASS when any domestic source works; offshore sources
are informational).

## Asset library and data snapshots

- **Snapshots (R8)**: `from findeck import snapshot` — `load_or_fetch` reuses the same-day
  snapshot for identical parameters and archives every real fetch to
  `data/snapshot_<source>_<digest>_<date>.parquet`; `FINDECK_SNAPSHOT=0` disables.
- **Asset library (R2)**: `from findeck import assets` — `archive` validates the manifest
  (all required fields), stores versions side by side (never overwritten), and rebuilds
  `index.md` + `index.json`. The seven tools in `packages/skill/tool-asset-library` (`asset_dir`,
  `asset_list`, `asset_search`, `asset_show`, `asset_graph`, `asset_run`, `asset_run_bg`) expose
  that library to a session; the [tool catalog](../docs/tool-catalog.md) documents each. Archiving
  discipline: `findeck-research` step 8.

Manifest v2 adds six fields — `origin` (agent/user/imported), `verbs` (declared actions; no verbs, no
archive), `freshness` (`as_of` + `update_frequency`, required for datasets), `lineage` (`producer`
script/params/session + `inputs`), `tags`, and `face` (a `face.json` path inside the version
directory) — and `index.json` v2 summarises all of them per asset and per version. New sessions find
assets with `asset_search` (kind/origin/tag/verb/keyword/freshness), which reads that index.
Pipelines archive through the same door: each produced version gets `version = max + 1`, an
auto-filled `supersedes`, `origin='agent'`, `depends_on`/`lineage.inputs` from the step's `inputs`,
and `lineage.producer = {script, params, session}`, so the lineage chain accumulates while the step
script writes no manifest. The `weekly-healthcheck` pipeline probes every dataset with its `preview`
verb, flags stale `freshness.as_of` dates and assets untouched for 90 days, and archives the outcome
as the report asset `asset-health-report`; touches come from `usage.jsonl` (written by the asset
tools) plus `pipeline-runs/*.jsonl`.

## Maintenance notes

- akshare interfaces churn fastest: when one breaks, update the table in
  `findeck-market-data-cn` after checking the latest parameters against the
  [akshare docs](https://akshare.akfamily.xyz/).
- When the model ecosystem shifts (new time-series foundation models and so on), update the
  repository table in `findeck-quant-models`.
- Every skill's YAML frontmatter must carry `name` (kebab-case) and `description`; the description is bilingual — Chinese first, then `English:` — per the [description language rule](../docs/subsystems/skills.md#description-language).
