# Voice input

English | [中文](voice-input.zh.md)

Experimental speech recognition has two host roles: the [Service Definition](../../packages/experimental/speech-to-text/README.md) `ctx.speechToText` routes named providers and owns recognition, and the [Remote consumer](../../packages/experimental/api-speech-to-text/README.md) `ctx.speechController` serves the browser. The microphone UI mounts `conversation.input.activity`; recognition itself writes no Session event, so ordinary submission owns the final model-visible text.

## Provider selection

`SpeechProviderId` brands the registration identity. `SpeechProviderInfo` carries a display name, accepted language hints, and a host-local or cloud processing location. `SpeechRequest` contains WAV bytes plus optional provider and language selection; `resolve()` produces one `SpeechSpec` pinned to a captured provider instance, and `transcribe()` executes exactly that instance. A missing provider or an unsupported language fails; replacement or withdrawal invalidates resolved work, and audio never falls back to a different provider.

## Browser and Host ownership

The browser owns microphone tracks and the unsent draft; `TranscriptionRequest` sends canonical base64 PCM16 WAV through the authenticated Remote. `SpeechCatalog` advertises the available providers, the resolved default, and the recording byte and duration limits. Preparation is a Host-owned task: `prepare()` starts or joins it, `cancelPreparation()` settles it, and `follow()` observes readiness independently of any page lifetime, so closing an observer never cancels the work.

## Cordis API

Generated from source by `scripts/gen-cordis-catalog.ts` (regenerate with `pnpm run gen-cordis-catalog`) — the language sides differ only in locale-specific paired document paths. Signature blocks use a `ts cordis-catalog` fence and keep the original source JSDoc; dispatch modes are defined in the [primer](../cordis-primer.md#dispatch-modes), and the framework-inherited `ctx` API lives in [cordis-api/inherited.md](../cordis-api/inherited.md).

### `ctx.speechController` — `SpeechController`

Speech calls never activate or submit to an Agent.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Read provider choices without preparing a recognizer.
 * @returns available providers, resolved default, and recording limits.
 */
@Remote catalog(): SpeechCatalog

/**
 * Follow provider readiness independently of Session and preparation lifetimes.
 * @param signal - Client observation lifetime.
 * @returns initial and subsequent complete readiness snapshots.
 */
@Remote({ mode: 'stream' }) async *follow(signal: AbortSignal): AsyncIterable<SpeechCatalog>

/**
 * Persist the user's recognition preferences.
 * @param patch - changed preference fields.
 * @returns after preferences are saved.
 */
@Remote configure(patch: SpeechSelectionPatch): Promise<void>

/**
 * Start or join one Host-owned preparation task.
 * @param providerId - selected recognizer.
 * @param options - task-local source selection validated by the provider.
 */
@Remote prepare(providerId: SpeechProviderId, options?: SpeechPreparationOptions): void

/**
 * Explicitly cancel resource preparation.
 * @param providerId - selected recognizer.
 * @returns after the preparation task settles.
 */
@Remote cancelPreparation(providerId: SpeechProviderId): Promise<void>

/**
 * Validate and transcribe one recording through the explicit provider selection.
 * @param request - canonical WAV encoded as base64, provider id and language hint.
 * @param signal - Client cancellation or Remote contribution disposal.
 * @returns final transcript without adding a Session event.
 */
@Remote async transcribe(request: TranscriptionRequest, signal: AbortSignal): Promise<Transcript>

### `ctx.speechToText` — `SpeechToText`

Registry shared by all transcription consumers in one Host composition.

```ts cordis-catalog
/**
 * Register one recognizer; duplicate ids fail without replacing the original.
 * @param provider - recognizer owned by the contributing fiber.
 * @returns idempotent disposer which rejects admission, cancels, and joins accepted work.
 */
register(provider: SpeechProvider): () => Promise<void>

/**
 * Read the current recognizer roster.
 * @returns available provider facts in registration order.
 */
listProviders(): readonly SpeechProviderInfo[]

/**
 * Observe complete readiness snapshots; a slow reader coalesces intermediate progress.
 * @param caller - observer lifetime, independent of any preparation task.
 * @returns an initial snapshot followed by the latest provider states.
 */
async *follow(caller: AbortSignal): AsyncIterable<SpeechSnapshot>

/**
 * Read provider readiness and current user preferences together.
 * @returns one detached complete observation.
 */
snapshot(): SpeechSnapshot

/**
 * Persist changed selection fields into this plugin's profile entry; the resulting language must be accepted by the selected provider.
 * @param patch - explicit provider or language changes.
 * @returns after the profile write and the live update it applies.
 */
async configure(patch: SpeechSelectionPatch): Promise<void>

/**
 * Start or join provider-owned preparation.
 * @param id - exact registered provider identity.
 * @param options - task-local source selection validated by the provider.
 */
prepare(id: SpeechProviderId, options?: SpeechPreparationOptions): void

/**
 * Explicitly cancel provider preparation without tying it to a browser connection.
 * @param id - exact registered provider identity.
 * @returns after the preparation task settles.
 */
async cancelPreparation(id: SpeechProviderId): Promise<void>

/**
 * Apply composition defaults and capture the selected provider. Missing providers and unsupported languages fail explicitly.
 * @param request - complete recording and optional selection.
 * @returns provider-pinned input for transcribe().
 */
resolve(request: SpeechRequest): SpeechSpec

/**
 * Execute exactly the resolved provider; no fallback sends audio elsewhere.
 * @param spec - resolved input; a withdrawn or replaced registration is rejected.
 * @param signal - caller cancellation.
 * @returns final transcript after provider settlement.
 */
async transcribe(spec: SpeechSpec, signal: AbortSignal): Promise<Transcript>
